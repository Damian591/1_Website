        <p>In this article, you will find all information about plastic surgery in Lithuania – from medical standards to best surgeons, prices, variety of surgeries, flight information, the processes and recommendations for a clinic.</p>
        <br>
		<h2>Why is Lithuania famous for plastic surgery?</h2>
	
        <div class="img-container">

        </div>
		<h2>Less expensive than in other European countries</h2>
		<p>Plastic surgery in Lithuania will save you around 20-50% of the surgery cost compared to most countries in Europe and the UK.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Depending on the desired procedure scale, savings can account for 500 – 3000 or more euros.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Despite lower prices, you can expect splendid operation outcomes and the highest quality customer service.</p>
		<br>
		
		<h2>Highest quality European standards</h2>
		<p>Lithuania boasts one of the highest beauty standards in the world, and thus world-class cosmetic surgery is no exception.</p>
		<br>
		<p>The clinics in Lithuania are modern and deluxe, while doctors use the latest and most reliable treatment methods with state-of-the-art operating equipment.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Lithuania’s medical equipment and quality are strictly regulated by European standards, while Turkey cannot offer the same quality guarantee.</p>
		
		<h2>Shorter waiting times</h2>
		<p>The waiting time in Lithuania for plastic surgery is usually shorter than in more populated European countries.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Suppose you do not wish to wait half a year or more to receive plastic surgery in your country. In that case, you should consider Lithuania as a superior alternative.</p>
		<br>
		<p>You can book a consultation with one of the plastic surgeons in Klaipeda (beach city) or Vilnius (capital city) to find the waiting time for your desired procedure.</p>
		
		<h2>Lithuanian Surgeons are among the best in the world</h2>
		<p>Lithuanian surgeons are experienced specialists with long years of experience performing plastic operations daily.</p>
		<br>
		<p>They constantly participate in conferences and training to keep the standards up-to-date with the newest trends and practices.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Professional specialists in reconstructive and cosmetic surgeries are also members of societies in Lithuania and abroad.</p>
		<br>
		<p>It is a common practice among surgeons to enhance their skills in many countries worldwide yearly.</p>
		
		<h2>Staff can speak multiple languages at clinics</h2>
		<p>You do not need to worry about the language barrier because all staff at clinics usually speaks English and Russian fluently.</p>
		<br>
		<p>From plastic surgeons to dermatologists, beauty therapists, ENT physicians, orthopaedic traumatologists, and masseuses – all staff should be able to talk to you freely about the details of your procedure and recovery.</p>

		<h2>Lithuania is a hidden gem in Europe with beaches and lively culture to experience</h2>
		<p>Lithuania is a spectacular country with beautiful sandy beaches and relatively warm temperatures of around 20 degrees Celcius in summer in Klaipeda city.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Suppose you wish to do some fun activities. In that case, you can consider booking a tour (which we can organise), exploring the Curonian Spit (Unesco heritage) or a cosy old town with local cafes and bars.</p>
		<br>
		<p>If you desire more relaxing time, you can rest by walking by the sea, have massages, and rise to a 21st-floor rooftop for a fantastic sunset. One thing is for sure – you will find activities you’ll enjoy in beautiful Klaipeda city.</p>
		<br>
		<p>While the capital city Vilnius is surrounded by castles, sparkling light green lakes, lush parks and mesmerising cultural architecture. Vilnius was the European capital of culture.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Wintertime in Vilnius is something magical and totally worth experiencing. As well as in summer, the energy in the capital is filled with action and arts.</p>
		<br>
		<p>So, why not combine the surgery with a vacation?</p>
